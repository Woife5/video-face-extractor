# Python face sxtractor

## Setup

1. Create the /srcvideos and /faces directories
2. Put your video files in /srcvideos (for the best results the faces within the video should be nicely visible)
3. Check the extract-faces.py script to make sure all parameters are set correctly
4. Run the script either by opening the Docker devcontainer or by installing all dependencies locally and running the script from the command line

    `python3 extract-faces.py`
